## **About me**

### Hello! My name is Kushal Reddy. I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Business Analytics and Information Systems at the University of South Florida. Prior to this, I had the privilege to work as a Software Engineer in a healthcare company, where I gathered substantial experience in the field. Additionally, I've undertaken various academic and personal projects, all of which can be found on my Git repository. I am passionate about leveraging data and technology to drive decision-making, and I'm always eager to take on new challenges in the analytics realm.
